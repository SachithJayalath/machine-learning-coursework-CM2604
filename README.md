Determining the income level is a significant issue with applications in loan approval, targeted marketing, and economic research. This research explores the use of machine learning models to predict whether an individual's yearly income would exceed $50,000 using census data.

This was achieved by utilizing two machine learning methods:
### 1. Random Forest Classification
### 2. Naive Bayes

The research also evaluates the functionality of these models and compares their ability to estimate income levels using the census data that has been supplied.
